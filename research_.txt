                        <h3>Multi-scale Dynamics and Scale Interactions</h3>
                        <p>My research in wall-bounded turbulence focuses on understanding the intricate dynamics of turbulent structures across multiple scales, particularly the interactions between large-scale outer structures and small-scale near-wall turbulence at high Reynolds numbers. These interactions become increasingly significant as Reynolds number increases, fundamentally altering the statistical characteristics of the flow and affecting key engineering quantities such as wall friction and heat transfer.</p>
                        <p>Through detailed analysis of direct numerical simulation data, I have developed novel methodologies for scale separation and analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the modulation effects of large-scale structures on near-wall turbulence. This work has challenged existing paradigms, particularly the quasi-steady hypothesis, by revealing complex asymmetric responses and non-linear interactions that conventional models fail to capture.</p>

                    <h3>A New Paradigm for Flow Analysis and Control</h3>
                    <p>Traditional approaches to flow modeling and control face significant challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional, non-linear, and multi-scale nature of turbulent flows. My research leverages machine learning techniques to overcome these limitations, offering a transformative framework for studying complex fluid dynamics problems.</p>
                    <p>Rather than following the classical sequential process of understanding, modeling, and then optimizing, my approach employs an iterative methodology that couples data-driven modeling with optimization of control strategies. This paradigm shift enables more efficient discovery of effective control laws and deeper insights into flow physics.</p>
                    <p>The integration of physical knowledge with data-driven methods is a cornerstone of my research philosophy. By embedding physical constraints and domain expertise into machine learning architectures, I develop models that are both accurate and physically consistent, bridging the gap between purely data-driven approaches and traditional physics-based modeling.</p>

                        <h4>Feature Extraction with Auto-Encoders</h4>
                        <p>The first step involves using specialized auto-encoder architectures to extract the most relevant features from high-dimensional flow data. These neural networks compress the complex flow information into a low-dimensional latent space that captures the essential dynamics of the system. By analyzing this latent representation, we can identify coherent structures and dominant flow patterns that would be difficult to detect with traditional methods.</p>

                        <p>The low-dimensional representation from the auto-encoder is further analyzed using clustering algorithms to identify distinct flow states and their transitions. This approach enables the construction of reduced-order dynamical models that can efficiently predict the temporal evolution of the flow. By combining the auto-encoder with clustering techniques, we obtain a powerful framework for understanding complex flow dynamics in a computationally efficient manner.</p>

                        <p>To enhance the reliability and physical consistency of the models, I incorporate domain knowledge and physical constraints into the machine learning algorithms. This physics-informed approach ensures that the predictions respect fundamental conservation laws and physical principles, leading to more robust and interpretable models. The integration of physical knowledge also improves the generalization capabilities of the models to conditions not seen in the training data.</p>

Advanced optimization algorithms, including reinforcement learning, are employed to explore the parameter space efficiently and identify optimal control laws. This data-driven approach to flow control has demonstrated significant potential for discovering novel control strategies that outperform traditional methods.</p>

                        <p>My future research aims to develop innovative control strategies that operate simultaneously at different scales of turbulence, allowing for enhancement or limitation of heat transfer across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. This multi-scale approach will target both near-wall structures and large-scale outer motions, exploiting their interactions to achieve unprecedented control capabilities.</p>
                        <p>By leveraging the understanding of scale interactions gained from my previous work, I plan to design control algorithms that can adaptively respond to the multi-scale nature of the flow, providing more effective and robust performance than single-scale approaches. This research will have significant impact on renewable energy development and improvement of industrial processes using heat exchangers.</p>

This hybrid approach will combine the interpretability and generalizability of physics-based models with the flexibility and predictive power of machine learning algorithms.</p>

These models will leverage online learning techniques and transfer learning approaches to continuously update their predictions based on new observations.</p>
                        <p>A key aspect of this research will be the integration of these adaptive models with sensing and actuation systems to create intelligent control frameworks that can optimize performance in real-time.
